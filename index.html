    <p>
        I have around 3 years of experience. I started with coding camps about web development, 
        and I'm currently a student at Yale University.
        <br>
        I'm intersted in 
        <strong>tech education</strong>, 
        <strong>software engineering</strong>, and 
        <strong>artifical intelligence</strong>.
       These are my current interested, but I'm excited to see where CS takes me.
